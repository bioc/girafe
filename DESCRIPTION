Description: The package 'girafe' deals with the genome-level
        representation of aligned reads from next-generation sequencing
        data. It contains an object class for enabling a detailed
        description of genome intervals with aligned reads and
        functions for comparing, visualising, exporting and working
        with such intervals and the aligned reads. As such, the package
        interacts with and provides a link between the packages
        ShortRead, IRanges and genomeIntervals.
