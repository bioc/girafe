Changes in version 1.1.3

   o Added a NEWS file

   o added a 'sort' method for AlignedGenomeIntervals to sort them 
     by chromosome number > start position > end position

   o added a 'hist' method for AlignedGenomeIntervals which creates
     a histogram of the lengths of the reads aligned to the intervals
     The method behaves very much like 'hist' from package graphics
     with respect to arguments and returned value


Changes in version 1.1.2

   o in function 'fracoverlap', the argument 'min.frac' now applies
     to both intervals and specifies the minimum required fraction of
     each of the two interval widths by which two intervals should 
     overlap in order to be marked as truly overlapping (before: only
     applied to the shorter of the two intervals)
