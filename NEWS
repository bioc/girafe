Changes in version 1.1.15

   o Certain functions (reduce, interval_overlap, fracOverlap)
     got an extra argument 'mem.friendly' that if set to TRUE
     (default: FALSE) leads to the data broken down into
     chromosome-wise batches for the computations, and thus
     for a "memory-friendlier", but slower, version of these
     computations.

Changes in version 1.1.12

   o Added a new function 'agiFromBam' which uses Rsamtools
     for creating AlignedGenomeIntervals objects directly
     from BAM files

Changes in version 1.1.6

   o Added an 'id' slot to AlignedGenomeIntervals objects, which
     allows users to assign a custom identifier to each interval

Changes in version 1.1.5

   o Added a 'sample' method for AlignedGenomeIntervals objects
     Consists of drawing a random sample of n of the aligned reads
     and returning the AlignedGenomeIntervals object defined by
     these aligned reads

Changes in version 1.1.3

   o Added a NEWS file

   o added a 'sort' method for AlignedGenomeIntervals to sort them 
     by chromosome number > start position > end position

   o added a 'hist' method for AlignedGenomeIntervals which creates
     a histogram of the lengths of the reads aligned to the intervals
     Like the 'hist' function from package graphics, it returns an
     object of class 'histogram' and accepts the argument 'plot=FALSE'

Changes in version 1.1.2

   o in function 'fracoverlap', the argument 'min.frac' now applies
     to both intervals and specifies the minimum required fraction of
     each of the two interval widths by which two intervals should 
     overlap in order to be marked as truly overlapping (before: only
     applied to the shorter of the two intervals)
